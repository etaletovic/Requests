# Requests
Async HttpClient implementation with **Result**, **Grand Central Dispatch** and **DispatchSemaphore**.
Idea based on Michael Long's [post](https://medium.com/@michaellong/how-to-chain-api-calls-using-swift-5s-new-result-type-and-gcd-56025b51033c).

## Rationale 
I needed something similiar to how I make network requests with C# hence this repo.
